Coding Interviews:

Iteration + Recursion
Arrays + Matrices
linked lists
Queues + Stacks + Heaps
Sets + Hash maps
Tress + Binary search
Tries
Graphs + BFS + DFS
Sorting(especially merge sort and quick sort)
bit manipulation

Dynamic Programming
Memoization, Divide and Conquer
Induction proofs

Pratice problems using :
Multiple pointers
Sliding windows
Greedy Algorithms
OOPS

1) Most powerful datastructure is Hash map so use it
2) use lot of stacks and queues
3) use sets and dfs
